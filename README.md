# CU Boulder AI Club Workshop Lectures
This is a collection of the slides I used for my workshop series for the CU Boulder AI Club, where I started from talking about how to code and I worked towards helping students/members understand AI/ML, and taught them how to build models. These workshops will culminate in Dec. 2025 in students creating their own AI/ML projects for a small inter-club competition!
